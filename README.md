# WoT-Changer
This is a small and easy tool for disabling the torrent download in World of Tanks


## how to use it

1. Download [here](https://github.com/zocker-160/WoT-Changer/releases) - **first release will come very soon!**
2. Copy the `WoT-Changer.exe` into your World of Tanks installation folder
3. run it ;)


it's possible that you have to run **WoT-Changer** after every update of the WoT Client / Game because this may activate the torrent download again.


(Wargaming doesn't want you to use the direct download ;) )
